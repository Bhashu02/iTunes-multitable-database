# iTunes-multitable-database
Created a database using a particular playlist from iTunes. 

To test this code, make sure to have the Library.xml and iTunes_database.py files to be in the same location. 

Open Terminal and check it out. 

To make this more interesting, download your own iTunes playlist as an xml file and create your own database. 

IMPORTANT:You must have an SQL Browser for the .sqlite file to be executed. I would recommend DB Browser for SQLite (https://sqlitebrowser.org)
